This course was run in conjunction with CNIT272 Database Fundamentals. The case study was based on the Director's Guild of America (DGA), an entertainment guild that represents the interests of film and television directors in the US motion picture industry.
Me and 4 fellow students collaborated to complete the semester-long cumulative project that was ran together the CNIT272 database project.
The case study folder documents the systems analysis and design diagrams we fulfilled as part of the case study. 
We created various use-case narratives such as account creation or member log in and created requirements from then.
The project folder documents the sample deployment of what we eventually decided on as a website, created in HTML/CSS. It had various functions for the current and future users of the website based off of the use-case narratives.
